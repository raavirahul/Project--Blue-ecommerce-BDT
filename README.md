# 📊 Customer Review Sentiment Prediction for BLU – A Big Data Spark Project

## 📝 Project Description

This project was developed as part of an academic Big Data course focused on solving a real-world business problem using Apache Spark in an intercultural team setting.

We collaborated with **BLU**, a French e-commerce company, to analyze customer behavior and predict the **sentiment of customer review scores** (positive or negative) after an order is placed. BLU faces strong competition from Amazon.fr and Cdiscount.fr, and while they excel at acquiring new customers, they underperform in repeat business. Understanding customer satisfaction is a key step in improving retention and brand loyalty.

Our solution involved building a scalable data pipeline and a machine learning model using **Apache Spark**, enabling BLU’s marketing team to identify the key drivers behind positive or negative reviews.
